# Juggling Animations

These are a collection of animations I made using [ManimCE](https://www.manim.community/), a community-maintained python library for mathematical animation, based on the work of Grant Sanderson at [3blue1brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com). I made these for use in [my project](https://github.com/adamkapilow/A-Geometric-Theory-of-Prechac-Transformations) explaining the mathematics of the Pr√©chac transformation, a mathematical recipe for turning solo juggling patterns into partner juggling patterns.
